**Maisa's Whack Gallery**

For this assignment, I first asked my friends what their 'mole' would be if they had a chance to whack one thing over and over again. Their answers were the core of my inspiration and what later became the concept of this whack gallery. I decided to work with pure Javascript code, since I never coded a whack-a-mole before and I wanted to have enough of time to understand its core function during the buildup (and by repeating it). Originally, I wanted to work with React - which I figured would shoot my wings of creativity and the fun of quick decision-making. 

Due to the project's simplicity and pure nature, Live Server plugin extension within the preferred text editor is enough to boot it up. 

Else, I've taken the freedom to host it on Netlify, and you can acccess the gallery directly by clicking [here]:(https://whacollection.netlify.app/)

Enjoy the stroll!
